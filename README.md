# Portfolio!

## Please enjoy these functional scripts I have written for work and for fun, but mostly for work.

I'm particularly proud of [vs_scc_correction.py](https://github.com/MarkDavidSanders/portfolio/blob/main/vs_scc_correction.py), a multi-purpose SCC timing correction tool.

This tool was written to operate as an AWS lambda function which ingests an SQS payload containing the data it needs, but can easily be reworked as needed to fit other environments or operational methods.
